## Preparing summoning ceremmony

There is only three steps you should follow to summon the greatest AndrÃ© Marques. First, create the file where the prohibited words will remain (create **.env** file). Second, insert the secret passed by the ancient gods to communicate with us mortals (create a discord bot on [discord developers portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and insert the **bot token** on _.env_ file how is it in the .env.example file). Finnaly, enter the big communication company services and hack their credentials (create a new Google project, add the _Youtube API v3_ service and insert **youtube token** on .env).
